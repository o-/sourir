(* Hoisting assignments "x <- exp" as far up the callgraph as possible.
 *
 * Since we are not in SSA moving assignments is only possible (without further
 * analysis) if the assignments dominates all its uses. Otherwise we might
 * accidentally capture uses on some traces.
 *
 * The condition for a move to be valid is that the move target dominates the
 * move origin (ie. we are moving upwards) and is dominated by all reaching
 * defs (ie. we are not moving above our dependencies).
 *
 * We only look at our own use-def chain. Thus the transformation renames the
 * variable to avoid overriding unrelated uses of the same name.
